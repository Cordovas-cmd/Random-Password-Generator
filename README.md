# Random-Password-Generator

## Description

In this project I have created a Random password generator that will start when the "Get Password" button is clicked.

Random password generators can be useful when wanting to come up with a more secure password that is hard to guess due to 

it's numerous criteria and lack of predictable patterns. 

The user will then be presented prompt the user to pick a length between 8-128.

After choosing length they will be prompet on whether or not to include a certain criteria into their generated password.

It will then verify that the generated password meets all selected criteria and returns a valid randomly generated password.
